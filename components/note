// Deploying to Netlify from the terminal
Step 1: Put Your Next.js Site Code in a Git Repo
While this is technically optional, the magic of Netlify is that every push to the main branch your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo triggers a new build and deploy of your site.

Step 2: Create a New Netlify Site From Your Next.js Site Repo
Now that our code is available in a repo, we can configure Netlify to deploy our Next.js site any time a new commit is pushed.

This is possible in two ways: using the Netlify CLI, and using the Netlify app UI.

Netlify provides a powerful CLI that allows you to interact with your account. This means you can deploy a Next.js site to Netlify without ever leaving the command line! I love this option because it's fast and I can do it at the same time as I push the repo code to GitHub for the first time.

If you don't already have it, install the Netlify CLI globally and log in:

# install the Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# after the above code you will get a depreciation warning you should do
npm update

# log into your Netlify account
ntl login
Next, navigate to the site's root directory and run ntl init:

# move into the site's root directory
cd ~/path/to/your/nextjs-site/

# create a new Netlify site
ntl init

The CLI will guide you through configuring your new site:

Choose "Create & configure a new site"
Use the arrow keys to choose the Netlify team you want to deploy to
Choose a name for your site or leave it blank to have one auto-generated (you can change this later)
Set the build command to next build
For the directory to deploy, enter out
Heads up! The directory to deploy can be anything you want except the current directory (.). Using the current directory would also publish your source code publicly.


To initialize a new git repo follow the steps below.

1. Initialize a new repo:

   git init

2. Add your files

   git add .

3. Commit your files

   git commit -m 'initial commit'

4. Create a new repo in GitHub https://github.com/new

5. Link the remote repo with this local directory

   git remote add origin git@github.com:YourGithubName/your-repo-slug.git

   git remote add origin https://github.com/RealRiga/New_Portfolio.git

6. Push up your files

   git push -u origin main

7. Initialize your Netlify Site

   netlify init
